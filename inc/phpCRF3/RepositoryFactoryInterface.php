 *    $repo = \F3\SomeRepository\RepositoryFactory::getRepository($parameters);
 *
 * Get a default repository available in this environment:
 *    $repo = \F3\PHPCR\RepositoryFactory::getRepository();

	 * @return \F3\PHPCR\RepositoryInterface a repository instance or NULL if this implementation does not understand the passed parameters
	 * @throws \F3\PHPCR\RepositoryException if getRepository fails or if no suitable (default) repository is found.
