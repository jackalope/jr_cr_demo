/**

 * automatically called, depending on whether the Item in question is a Node
 * or a Property. Different implementations of this interface can be written
 * for different purposes. It is, for example, possible for the visit(Node)
 * method to call accept on the children of the passed node and thus recurse
 * through the tree performing some operation on each Item.
