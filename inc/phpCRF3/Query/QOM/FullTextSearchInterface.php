/**
 * Performs a full-text search.
 *
 * The full-text search expression is evaluated against the set of full-text
 * indexed properties within the full-text search scope. If property is
 * specified, the full-text search scope is the property of that name on the
 * selector node in the node-tuple; otherwise the full-text search scope is all
 * properties of the selector node (or, in some implementations, all properties
 * in the node subtree).
 *
 * Which properties (if any) in a repository are full-text indexed is
 * implementation determined.
 *
 * It is also implementation determined whether fullTextSearchExpression is
 * independently evaluated against each full-text indexed property in the
 * full-text search scope, or collectively evaluated against the set of such
 * properties using some implementation-determined mechanism.
 *
 * Similarly, for multi-valued properties, it is implementation determined
 * whether fullTextSearchExpression is independently evaluated against each
 * element in the array of values, or collectively evaluated against the array
 * of values using some implementation-determined mechanism.
 *
 * At minimum, an implementation must support the following
 * fullTextSearchExpression grammar:
 *
 *  fullTextSearchExpression ::= [-]term {whitespace [OR] whitespace [-]term}
 *  term ::= word | '"' word {whitespace word} '"'
 *  word ::= (A string containing no whitespace)
 *  whitespace ::= (A string of only whitespace)

 * A query satisfies a FullTextSearch constraint if the value (or values) of the
 * full-text indexed properties within the full-text search scope satisfy the
 * specified fullTextSearchExpression, evaluated as follows:
 *
 *  A term not preceded with "-" (minus sign) is satisfied only if the value contains that term.
 *  A term preceded with "-" (minus sign) is satisfied only if the value does not contain that term.
 *  Terms separated by whitespace are implicitly "ANDed".
 *  Terms separated by "OR" are "ORed".
 *  "AND" has higher precedence than "OR".
 *  Within a term, each double quote ("), "-" (minus sign), and "\" (backslash) must be escaped by a preceding "\" (backslash).
