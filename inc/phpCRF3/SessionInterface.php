	/**
	 * Returns an org.xml.sax.ContentHandler which can be used to push SAX events

	 * does not appear to be a JCR system view XML document then it is interpreted
	 * as a JCR document view XML document.
	 * The incoming XML is deserialized into a subtree of items immediately below
	 * the node at parentAbsPath.
	 *
	 * This method simply returns the ContentHandler without altering the state of
	 * the session; the actual deserialization to the session transient space is done through the methods of the ContentHandler. Invalid XML data will cause the ContentHandler to throw a SAXException.
	 *
	 * As SAX events are fed into the ContentHandler, the tree of new items is built
	 * in the transient storage of the session. In order to persist the new content, save must be called. The advantage of this through-the-session method is that (depending on which constraint checks the implementation leaves until save) structures that violate node type constraints can be imported, fixed and then saved. The disadvantage is that a large import will result in a large cache of pending nodes in the session. See Workspace.getImportContentHandler(java.lang.String, int) for a version of this method that does not go through the session.
	 *
	 * The flag uuidBehavior governs how the identifiers of incoming (deserialized)
	 * nodes are handled. There are four options:
	 *
	 * ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_CREATE_NEW: Incoming identifiers nodes are added
	 * in the same way that new node is added with Node.addNode. That is, they are either
	 * assigned newly created identifiers upon addition or upon save (depending on the
	 * implementation). In either case, identifier collisions will not occur.
	 * ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING: If an incoming node has
	 * the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace then the already
	 * existing node (and its subtree) is removed from wherever it may be in the workspace
	 * before the incoming node is added. Note that this can result in nodes "disappearing"
	 * from locations in the workspace that are remote from the location to which the
	 * incoming subtree is being written. Both the removal and the new addition will be
	 * persisted on save.
	 * ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING: If an incoming node has
	 * the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace, then the
	 * already-existing node is replaced by the incoming node in the same position as the
	 * existing node. Note that this may result in the incoming subtree being disaggregated
	 * and "spread around" to different locations in the workspace. In the most extreme
	 * case this behavior may result in no node at all being added as child of parentAbsPath.
	 * This will occur if the topmost element of the incoming XML has the same identifier as
	 * an existing node elsewhere in the workspace. The change will be persisted on save.
	 * ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_THROW: If an incoming node has the same
	 * identifier as a node already existing in the workspace then a SAXException is thrown
	 * by the ContentHandler during deserialization.
	 * Unlike Workspace.getImportContentHandler, this method does not necessarily enforce
	 * all node type constraints during deserialization. Those that would be immediately
	 * enforced in a normal write method (Node.addNode, Node.setProperty etc.) of this
	 * implementation cause the returned ContentHandler to throw an immediate SAXException
	 * during deserialization. All other constraints are checked on save, just as they are
	 * in normal write operations. However, which node type constraints are enforced depends

	 * Deserializes an XML document and adds the resulting item subtree as a
	 * child of the node at parentAbsPath.
	 * If the incoming XML stream does not appear to be a JCR system view XML
	 * document then it is interpreted as a document view XML document.
	 *
	 * The passed InputStream is closed before this method returns either normally
	 * or because of an exception.
	 *
	 * The tree of new items is built in the transient storage of the Session. In order
	 * to persist the new content, save must be called. The advantage of this
	 * through-the-session method is that (depending on what constraint checks the
	 * implementation leaves until save) structures that violate node type constraints
	 * can be imported, fixed and then saved. The disadvantage is that a large import
	 * will result in a large cache of pending nodes in the session. See
	 * Workspace.importXML(java.lang.String, java.io.InputStream, int) for a version
	 * of this method that does not go through the Session.
	 *
	 * The flag uuidBehavior governs how the identifiers of incoming (deserialized)
	 * nodes are handled. There are four options:
	 *
	 * ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_CREATE_NEW: Incoming nodes are added in the same
	 * way that new node is added with Node.addNode. That is, they are either assigned
	 * newly created identifiers upon addition or upon save (depending on the implementation,
	 * see 4.9.1.1 When Identifiers are Assigned in the specification). In either case,
	 * identifier collisions will not occur.
	 * ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING: If an incoming node has
	 * the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace then the already
	 * existing node (and its subtree) is removed from wherever it may be in the workspace
	 * before the incoming node is added. Note that this can result in nodes "disappearing"
	 * from locations in the workspace that are remote from the location to which the
	 * incoming subtree is being written. Both the removal and the new addition will be
	 * persisted on save.
	 * ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING: If an incoming node
	 * has the same identifier as a node already existing in the workspace, then the
	 * already-existing node is replaced by the incoming node in the same position as
	 * the existing node. Note that this may result in the incoming subtree being
	 * disaggregated and "spread around" to different locations in the workspace. In the
	 * most extreme case this behavior may result in no node at all being added as child
	 * of parentAbsPath. This will occur if the topmost element of the incoming XML has
	 * the same identifier as an existing node elsewhere in the workspace. The change
	 * will only be persisted on save.
	 * ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_THROW: If an incoming node has the same
	 * identifier as a node already existing in the workspace then an
	 * ItemExistsException is thrown.
	 * Unlike Workspace.importXML(java.lang.String, java.io.InputStream, int), this
	 * method does not necessarily enforce all node type constraints during deserialization.
	 * Those that would be immediately enforced in a normal write method (Node.addNode,
	 * Node.setProperty etc.) of this implementation cause an immediate
	 * ConstraintViolationException during deserialization. All other constraints are
	 * checked on save, just as they are in normal write operations. However, which node
	 * type constraints are enforced depends upon whether node type information in the
	 * imported data is respected, and this is an implementation-specific issue (see
	 * 5.4.3 Respecting Property Semantics in the specification).
	 *
	 * @param string $parentAbsPath the absolute path of the node below which the deserialized subtree is added.
	 * @param resource $in The Inputstream from which the XML to be deserialized is read.
	 * @param integer $uuidBehavior a four-value flag that governs how incoming identifiers are handled.
	 * @return void
	 * @throws \RuntimeException if an error during an I/O operation occurs.
	 * @throws \F3\PHPCR\PathNotFoundException if no node exists at parentAbsPath and this implementation performs this validation immediately instead of waiting until save..
	 * @throws \F3\PHPCR\ItemExistsException if deserialization would overwrite an existing item and this implementation performs this validation immediately instead of waiting until save..
	 * @throws \F3\PHPCR\ConstraintViolationException if a node type or other implementation-specific constraint is violated that would be checked on a normal write method or if uuidBehavior is set to IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REMOVE_EXISTING and an incoming node has the same UUID as the node at parentAbsPath or one of its ancestors.
	 * @throws \F3\PHPCR\Version\VersionException if the node at parentAbsPath is versionable and checked-in, or its nearest versionable ancestor is checked-in and this implementation performs this validation immediately instead of waiting until save..
